## Hello There!

I am a 21 Year Old Developer from the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

I spent most of my development career as a full-stack Luau developer on Roblox. I now spend time building and maintianing web-based systems to improve employee efficiency for small buisiness.

I still contribute the OS projects within the Roblox developer community in my spare time.
